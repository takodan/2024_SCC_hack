    "Suitable or Not": "Potentially Suitable. Yu Chang meets several key qualifications with Python experience and projects related to web services, machine learning, and data analysis.  However, they lack experience in Java/Go and some specific compute platforms listed.  The candidate's background in psychology could be a differentiator, especially given Oracle's emphasis on diverse perspectives.  Further assessment is needed to determine their proficiency level in required skills and their fit for the internship program's objectives."
